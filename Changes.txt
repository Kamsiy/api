0.2.0 - Monday 1 May 2017
    * job output is now placed into a file on the webserver for download,
      simplifying the client API quite a bit and allowing better memory
      handling
    * added new job.getOutput(File) API that downloads the whole job output
      into a given file
    * updated job.getOutput() to use the new job.getOutput(File), with a
      temporary file that is deleted after reading into a string
    * updated job.getOutput(int, int) to do a Range HTTP request on the job
      output
